# Name:        mapMatcher
# Purpose:      This python script allows map matching in arcpy using a Hidden Markov model with
#               probabilities parameterized based on spatial + network distances. Follows the ideas in Newson, Krumm (2009):
#               Hidden markov Map Matching through noise and sparseness
